<p><b>Good question:</b></p>
<p>"Research by Hendrick Bessembinder, finance professor and Francis J. and Mary B. Labriola Endowed Chair in Competitive Business, found that returns from long-term stock investing are positively skewed, meaning that very large returns to a few stocks pull up the average, while most stocks post modest or negative returns". <a href="https://news.wpcarey.asu.edu/20180917-do-stocks-outperform-treasury-bills">Source</a> 
  <p></p>This research is extremely humbling to the industry, and it is imperative that investors understand the data.</p>

<p><b>What does this mean?</b></p>
<p>More than half of all the companies in the dataset had negative returns over the period. Data into the future will likely only look worse, as the average life of a company in the S&P500 continues to decline to it's current 15 years from 67 years.
    <a href="https://www.ey.com/en_gl/insights/consulting/how-businesses-can-stand-the-test-of-time#:~:text=The%20average%20lifespan%20of,Now%20it's%2015.&text=And%20it%20is%20expected%20to,appropriate%20resiliency%20and%20sustainability%20measures.">Source</a>

<p>Back to the study:</p>
<p>Bessembinder found that just 86 stocks accounted for $16 Trillion in wealth creation; half the entire market return over the last 90 years. 
    96% of all the stocks simply matched 1-month Treasury Bills.</p>
    <p>Bessembinder's research has been extensively covered, and has been published. From 1926 to 2019, net wealth creation of public markets has increased $34.8 Trillion.
<p>The gist is that: all of the wealth creation can be attributed to the thousand top-performing stocks, while the remaining 96 percent of stocks collectively matched one-month T-bills.</p>
  <p>"Bessembinder found that all of the $35 trillion in wealth that stocks created over and above Treasury bills returns between 1926 and 2016 could be attributed to just 1,092 companies, or 4.3 percent of the nearly 26,000 stocks that have been traded in the markets. 
    More than half of the $35 trillion came from just 90 companies, or less than one-third of 1 percent".</p>
<P>58 percent of the stocks failed to beat Treasury bill returns over their lives.</p>
<p>38 percent of stocks beat Treasury bill returns by just moderate amounts.</p>
  <p>Just over 4 percent of stocks are responsible for boosting the market's overall returns higher than those on Treasury bills.</p>
  <p><a href="https://news.wpcarey.asu.edu/20180917-do-stocks-outperform-treasury-bills">Source</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, data from this study: <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3710251">Source</a> show that - out of 64,000 globally listed securities - from 1990 to December 2020, over 50% of stocks underperform 1 month Treasuries and the top 2.4% of stocks account for all the $75.7Trillion in global net wealth creation. Outside of the US, it is 1.4%.
    
    <p>In this study: <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4897069">Source</a> We can see the reinforcing principle of long term free cash flow generation and low valuations for generating strong returns over time, as with the case of top performing Altria. 
        Long duration assets that generate significant free cash flow that can be returned to shareholders. </p>
        <p>Luckily a spreadsheet of the data of over 29,000 stocks from 1926 to 2023 was provided. I have created a histogram to show the distribution of returns, and illustrate just how few companies contribute to the net wealth creation of the market</p>

</div>
<p>And here we will take a look at the cumulative companies in the market. The absolute majority of companies that had high annualized returns only managd to do so for a few years. </p>
  <p>Seeing the cululative returns on all stocks during the period shows that the majority of firms actually lost or had negative returns during the period.</p>
  <p>Altria, being an extreme outlier with a cumulative return of over 2.5M is the highest total returning stock during the period. From there a handful of companies that make up the 90th percentile made up the majority of the market returns. Not owning these compaines would have had devastating affects on index or total market returns.</p>
